# Project State

**Last Updated:** 2026-08-18

## Current Status

**Project:** Cosmic1 Base Station Camera Control Extension
**Phase:** Phase 1 — plans 01-01 through 01-04 executed (gap closure complete); verification pending
**Milestone:** v1.0

## Progress

- ✅ Project initialized
- ✅ Requirements defined (24 requirements)

- ⏳ Phase 1 verification (verifier + hardware UAT)
- ✅ Phase 1 gap-closure plan 01-02 executed — protocol defects CR-01..CR-04 + WR-03/04/05 closed, D-05/D-07/D-16-support encoded (see 01-02-SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Phase 1 gap-closure plan 01-03 executed — all 7 settings forms + auto-capture UI (WR-07 long-first validation), D-16 Command Queue panel, IN-03 computed link LED (see 01-03-SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Phase 1 gap-closure plan 01-04 executed — real sensor setters for saturation/exposure/WB, AutoCapture interval timer module, truthful GET_STATUS, shared image-ID sequence, main-loop wiring (see 01-04-SUMMARY.md)
- ⏳ Phase 2: Image Transmission (pending)

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Command Protocol & Control**

- Status: executing — all 4 plans executed (01-01 tracer, 01-02 protocol closure, 01-03 base station UI, 01-04 balloon gap closure); code review + verification pending
- Requirements: 6 (CTRL-01, CTRL-02, CTRL-03, CTRL-04, CTRL-06, PRI-02)
- Goal: Establish bidirectional LoRa communication for camera control

### Delivered (code-level, builds green on both targets)

- Command protocol spec + CRC16 serializer (`include/command_protocol.h`, `src/command_protocol.cpp`)
- E32-900T30D UART LoRa driver (`include/e32_lora.h`, `src/e32_lora.cpp`)
- Base station sender with retry (3x, per-command ACK timeouts) (`src/command_sender.cpp`)
- Balloon command handler with ACK/NACK + CameraManager wiring (`src/command_handler.cpp`)
- Base station web UI: capture trigger + quality/brightness/contrast forms (`src/main_basestation.cpp`)
- Balloon integration + `esp32-s3-basestation` build env (`src/main_balloon.cpp`, `platformio.ini`)
- Protocol gap closure (01-02): CRC covers the real sequence byte (CR-01); shared CMD_MAX_PACKET_SIZE=240 with oversize rejection and correctly sized buffers (CR-02); length-driven framing in both receivers — embedded 0D 0A survives (CR-03); retry terminal states with D-05 ACK timeouts (2000/5000/10000ms), D-07 exponential backoff (2000/4000/8000ms), cancel guard (CR-04/WR-03/WR-04); STATUS responses typed end-to-end (WR-05); queue snapshot API for the D-16 UI view; host wire-format regression harness (`scripts/verify_protocol_roundtrip.mjs`)
- UI gap closure (01-03): all 7 camera settings forms + routes with WR-07 long-first validation (3 of 7 → 7 of 7); auto-capture card + `/auto-capture(-stop)` routes with 4-byte big-endian interval payload; D-16 Command Queue panel (pinned last command + every occupied slot, locked vocabulary, retry counts); IN-03 link LED computed from ACK activity (LINK_STALE_MS 30s); UI-SPEC spacing/typography harmonization + 480px collapse
- Balloon gap closure (01-04): CameraManager setSaturation/setExposure/setWBMode sensor setters + cached getters (7 of 7 settings execute for real; failed sensor calls NACK_BUSY); AutoCapture module (`include/auto_capture.h` + `src/auto_capture.cpp`) — wraparound-safe millis timer, enable() re-validates 1000..3600000 ms and resets the baseline (first capture one full interval after enable), baseline advances before the attempt so a failed capture cannot spin; single uint16 image-ID sequence shared by CAPTURE_NOW and interval captures; GET_STATUS reports tracked state; main_balloon.cpp loop wiring; auto_capture.cpp excluded from the basestation build — both targets green

### Key Decisions (01-02)

- D-05 encoded: ACK-timeout window selected per command type via `ackTimeoutFor()` — CAPTURE_NOW 2000ms, SET_* + auto-capture config 5000ms, GET_STATUS 10000ms; flat 2000ms constant removed
- D-07 encoded: retry pacing moved above the PENDING/SENT branches as exponential backoff (CMD_RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE_MS << shift, shift clamped at 2) — the waits pace both transmit-failure retries and ACK-timeout retries
- CR-03 fixed by length-driven framing (header body-length field announces the packet length; end marker tested only at the framed position) rather than byte escaping — symmetric fix in both receivers
- Host regression harness transcribes the wire format as an executable spec, including the defective pre-CR-01 serializer variant so the sweep provably has teeth (255/65535 accepted)

### Known Gaps (code-complete as of 01-04; all remaining gaps are hardware-UAT-only)

- No hardware tests run yet (T9/E5/A5 require radios + camera); the Command Queue panel, LED truth, auto-capture UI, sensor setters, and interval timing are code-proven only until UAT (item 4 in 01-VERIFICATION.md)
- Mode coexistence assumption: manual CAPTURE_NOW while auto-capture is enabled interleaves on the shared camera/ID sequence; a manual capture does not reset the auto-capture baseline (may cause back-to-back captures) — UAT item

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** Users can remotely control the balloon camera and view captured images through the base station web interface, with real-time telemetry and map tracking always available.

**Current focus:** Phase 01 — command-protocol-control

## Next Steps

1. **Code review gate:** `/gsd-code-review 1` (auto-invoked by execute-phase)
2. **Phase verification:** verifier re-runs after gap closure
3. **Hardware UAT:** flash both units, run command-flow tests (`/gsd-verify-work 1`) — CR-level fixes, sensor setters, and interval timing are code-proven only until the radio round-trip runs

## Configuration

**Mode:** YOLO (auto-approve)
**Granularity:** Coarse
**Execution:** Parallel
**Model Profile:** Adaptive

**Workflows Enabled:**

- Research: Yes
- Plan Check: Yes
- Verifier: Yes

**Git Tracking:** Enabled

## Performance Metrics

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01 P03 | 19 min | 3 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 01 P04 | 14 min | 2 tasks | 7 files |

## Decisions

- [Phase 01]: 01-03: chip and LED state latched server-side — auto-capture chip state latched from the newest ACKed AUTO_CAPTURE_ENABLE/DISABLE queue entry by sequence number (survives command-slot reuse); link LED red state requires lastTerminalFailTime newer than lastAckTime so a late ACK for an older command cannot mask a fresh TIMEOUT/FAILED — Plan 01-03 specifies ACK-gated chip semantics and the IN-03 prohibition on green-when-failed; slot reuse and ACK ordering are the two cases a naive per-poll derivation gets wrong
- [Phase 01]: 01-04: image IDs unified — AutoCapture owns the single uint16 ID sequence (allocateImageId pre-increments), shared by CAPTURE_NOW and interval captures so GET_STATUS lastImageId is truthful across both modes; enable() resets the baseline so the first capture fires one full interval after enable, and process() advances the baseline before the attempt so a failed capture cannot drive a tight failure loop (T-01-09 mitigation); interval bounds re-validated inside the module so a bypassed handler cannot drive the timer below 1 Hz (T-01-08)
